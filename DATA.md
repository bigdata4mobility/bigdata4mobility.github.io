# Open Source LBS Data
This page will explore the characteristics of some of the available open source LBS data.

## GeoLife
GeoLife data is a GPS trajectory dataset collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) GeoLife project by 182 users in a period of over three years (from April 2007 to August 2012).

### Spatial Sparsity (spatial gap)
- Spatial gap (jumping distance in kilometers, distance bwtween consecutive pings)

(insert figure/statistics here)

### Precision
- Spatial accuracy (uncertainty radius in meters)

(insert figure/statistics here)

### Representation
- Representative bias (share of LBS users in the area vs. population in the same area)

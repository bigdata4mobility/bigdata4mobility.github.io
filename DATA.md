# Open Source LBS Data
This page will explore the characteristics of some of the available open source LBS data.

## GeoLife
GeoLife data is a GPS trajectory dataset collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) GeoLife project by 182 users in a period of over three years (from April 2007 to August 2012).

### Data Stability
1. Number of devices over time

(insert figure/statistics here)

2. Number of records per device over time

(insert figure/statistics here)

### Temporal Sparsity (temporal gap)
1. Intra-day occupancy

(insert figure/statistics here)

2. Inter-day occupancy

(insert figure/statistics here)

### Spatial Sparsity (spatial gap)
1. Spatial gap (jumping distance in kilometers, distance bwtween consecutive pings)

(insert figure/statistics here)

### Precision
1. Spatial accuracy (uncertainty radius in meters)

(insert figure/statistics here)

### Representation
1. Representative bias (share of LBS users in the area vs. population in the same area)

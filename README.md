## A brief introduction of various datasets for transportation applications

^1^ active: transportation-related data is actively collected. For example, in HTS, respondents are asked to record all trips they made during a day. In online panels, respondents are asked about their general travel behaviors, e.g., how often they go to a workplace outside their home. Traffic count data are generated by traffic counters at specific locations for data collection. 
^2^ passive: data itself is not related transportation behaviors; instead, it is generated as a by-product for operation and billing purposes. Transportation-related data can be inferred from such data. For example, LBS mobile data contains users' interactions with the network from each transportation related data can be inferred. 

**An important note** is that while traditional datasets such as  household travel surveys and traffic counts directly provide us with transportation related information (trips subjects made in a day for household travel survey data and number of moving objects at a location during a time interval for traffic count data), big mobile data does not contain information directly about people's travel patterns. Instead, it contains information that reflects people's usage with their mobile phones. In this case, each record in the big mobile data represents an instance that the device communicates with the network at where and when.

## I. Key takeaways about LBS mobile data as compared to HTS

### Data generation 
1. LBS data itself does not any transportation related information. This means that all transportation related information must be inferred. 
2. LBS data does not contain any socio-demographics information, meaning that for any datasets containing such information, they are fused in. 

### Data stability
1. Number of devices contained in a dataset often changes over time. 
2. Number of records per device also changes over time. 

### Data quality metrics
1. LBS data is big,  covering a much larger share of the population in a region than HTS or online panels. 
2. Spatially, LBS data is quite precise (e.g., close to 95% of the observations have an uncertainty radius of less than 65 meters). 
3. Temporally, LBS data is quite sparse (e.g., add here). 

### Data biases
1. Number of records has a positive effect on trips inferred: the more records, the more trips inferred. 
2. Temporal occupancy (defined as the number of 30-min slots in a day when a device is observed) has a positive effect on trips inferred: the more one's records are temporally covered, the more trips inferred.
3. The effects of data quality metrics on mobility metrics (e.g., trip rates) are much larger than those of socio-demographics and the built environment characteristics. 
4. Setting different parameter values (primarily duration and spatial thresholds beyond which observations are no longer classified as clustering together) in an algorithm will lead to different inference results for the same mobility metric. Even the same parameter values (but different algorithms) will lead to different inference results for the same mobility metric.

<sup>1</sup> active: transportation-related data is actively collected. For example, in HTS, respondents are asked to record all trips they made during a day. In online panels, respondents are asked about their general travel behaviors, e.g., how often they go to a workplace outside their home. Traffic count data are generated by traffic counters at specific locations for data collection. \
<sup>2</sup> passive: data itself is not related transportation behaviors; instead, it is generated as a by-product for operation and billing purposes. Transportation-related data can be inferred from such data. For example, LBS mobile data contains users' interactions with the network from each transportation related data can be inferred. \
<sup>3</sup> A network interaction event takes place when a user interacts with an app on their mobile device. It results in a record in the LBS mobile dataset that records the location and the time of the event. \
<sup>4</sup> Every time a user taps their smartcard on a car reader in the transit system, it results in a record that records the location and the time of the event.

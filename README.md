<sup>1</sup> active: transportation-related data is actively collected. For example, in HTS, respondents are asked to record all trips they made during a day. In online panels, respondents are asked about their general travel behaviors, e.g., how often they go to a workplace outside their home. Traffic count data are generated by traffic counters at specific locations for data collection. \
<sup>2</sup> passive: data itself is not related transportation behaviors; instead, it is generated as a by-product for operation and billing purposes. Transportation-related data can be inferred from such data. For example, LBS mobile data contains users' interactions with the network from each transportation related data can be inferred. \
<sup>3</sup> A network interaction event takes place when a user interacts with an app on their mobile device. It results in a record in the LBS mobile dataset that records the location and the time of the event. \
<sup>4</sup> Every time a user taps their smartcard on a car reader in the transit system, it results in a record that records the location and the time of the event.
